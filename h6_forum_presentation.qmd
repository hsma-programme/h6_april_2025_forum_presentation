Slots are available at

- 1:00, 1:30 and 2:00 every Tuesday
- 11:30, 12:00 and 12:30 every Wedneday

Slots are currently available up until the second week of June.

Pop me a message if you can't make those times and we can work something out.

# Useful Tools - Notebook LM

## What is NotebookLM?

Notebook LM is a Google product that allows you to pass in specfic sources that will be used by a generative AI model.

You can feed it a range of sources, including google slides, Youtube vdeos, and webpages.


## Why might NotebookLM be useful to you?

Because it can be trained on specific sources, you can use it to remind yourself of the HSMA way of doing things.

## A note about code

Notebook LM has the really nice feature of actually referring back to the source it's used

## Other Features

The 'deep dive' feature is a way to get a good summary of complex information like scientific papers.

## Things to note

- Don't put anything private/sensitive in there!

- You can't share your notebook if you don't have a paid Google AI plan (which is a shame if you're working in a team)



# Automated Documentation Generation with Generative AI

## The Tool

This repository contains a script to automatically generate documentation from a codebase.

[https://github.com/The-Pocket/PocketFlow-Tutorial-Codebase-Knowledge](https://github.com/The-Pocket/PocketFlow-Tutorial-Codebase-Knowledge]

It's designed to write beginner-friendly documentation with loads of analogies and clear breakdowns of what is going on.

## Why is this useful?

Documentation is the thing no-one wants to do...

And it always goes out of date!

In addition, if you're trying to work with someone else's code, it can be really hard to get your head around how everything is done.

## Example page

## How does it do this?

The framework

- reads all of the files in the GitHub repository (or you can tell it to focus on only certain files or file types)
- passes this to your chosen LLM, which decides how best to split them up into chapters
- passes the chapter details to the LLM, which then writes several chapters in markdown format

(I've then been converting the output into Quarto for easy integration with existing documentation)

## Code Examples

It generates code examples...

## Diagrams

And diagrams...

## Prompt Editing

Because of the way this code is designed, you can modify the prompt that gets fed in.

It just lives in text in the `nodes.py` file.

## Custom Documentation

So you can ask it to make the documentation more or less beginner friendly, or add very specific requests.

## Considerations

Anything you feed into this *may* be fair game for model training.

And you certainly don't want to feed in anything that needs to remain private!

But if your repository is already open-source, then you may wish to consider it.

## Cost

Google's most advanced model (`gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25`) is currently **free** for roughly 25 requests a day.

For me, that was enough to generate two sets of documentation per day before hitting the limit.


## Further Info

I'll put together a quick guide on the 'how' in the next few days, but if you're keen to try it out sooner, have a go at following the instructions in the repository readme (and message me if you get stuck).
